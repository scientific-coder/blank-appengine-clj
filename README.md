# Blank App Engine CLJ
This is a template to allow you to create app engine projects easily. It is used as a starting off point to use compojure,hiccup, and google app engine.

Currently to satisify the build requirements for Google App Engine you must run a shell script provided in the distribution.

##Usage
./install.sh /path/to/appenginsdk/

This will use maven to manually install. This must be done before running anything else.
